Clean architecture in Node.js emphasizes separation of concerns and dependency inversion. Let's break it down into layers:

# Presentation Layer

Handles HTTP requests and responses.

# Application Layer

Contains business logic and coordinates the flow of data.

# Domain Layer

Defines entities and business rules.
Infrastructure Layer: Deals with external concerns like databases.
